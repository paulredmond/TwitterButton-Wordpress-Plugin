Automatically adds the new official Twitter tweet button after a post.

== Description ==

Automatically adds the official Tweet button after a post. All options available at http://dev.twitter.com/pages/tweet_button are configurable in the WordPress options area.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `twitterbutton` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the location the Tweet button will appear? =

As of 1.0, the location of the tweet button is after the body of a post (anywhere the_content() is called). I plan on allowing users to disable this filter and add the tweet button anywhere in the template.
